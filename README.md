# Calculation-Run-Time-reduction-using-FPGA
This project is an end of studies academic project. In this project i learnt multiple new technologies such as Python, FPGA and linux manipulation. 

The goal of this project is to reduced the latency and run-time of calculations done in a database to less than half.

To do so we had to implement those calculations in a FPGA board then we had to create the SoC and a RISC-V CPU around it

We used Litex as the SoC builder and Migen (Python based tool) to create the design.
